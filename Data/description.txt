The OSULeaf data set consist of one dimensional outlines of leaves. The series were obtained by color image segmentation and boundary extraction (in the anti-clockwise direction) from digitized leaf images of six classes: Acer Circinatum, Acer Glabrum, Acer Macrophyllum, Acer Negundo, Quercus Garryana and Quercus Kelloggii for the MSc thesis "Content-Based Image Retrieval: Plant Species Identification" by A. Grandhi.
